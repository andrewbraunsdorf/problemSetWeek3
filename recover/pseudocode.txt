Recover.c
 For (iterate through each file ending after complete)
	Name each file as ###.jpg iterate from 000 +1
	At each 0xff 0xd8 0xff, it should be a new file
Each block is 512 bytes (4096 bits)
1 byte = 8 bits
Read every 512 bytes… if first 4 are equal to 0xff 0xd8 0xff. if not go on to the next block… if the first 4 blocks == 0xff 0xd8 0xff and 4th block, then that should become a new file,
Continue reading in until another blow that indicates another jpeg, Close previous and open next.
Use fread function: one way is to read files in 512 blocks another way is read one block at a time for 512 blocks
If read wise operator

If this code returns as true then you found a jpeg
Use sprint to create a new file name for our jpeg
Open using fopen and include writing permissions
Write 512 bytes as a time

Fwrite( data, size, number)
Where the 512 points are and then the file where the bytes should be written to

Can no read and write… how do we stop?
Last block will not contain 512 bytes…it will be shorter than that
Find condition when we read in successfully for the 512 bytes and when we reach the end of the file.


0xff 0xd8 0xff indicate jpeg header
